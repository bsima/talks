* Abstract
Haskell can be a complex, powerful, highly abstract language. Usually these are
not features you find in web development like Ruby or Python frameworks. The
secret I will share with you is that Haskell can be simple, clear, and enjoyable
to write, even more so than Ruby/Python. This talk will introduce the Yesod web
framework and illustrate how Yesod's simple abstractions corrall Haskell's
complexity into an enjoyable and safe value-level language for web programming.
